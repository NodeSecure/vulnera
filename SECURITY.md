# Reporting Security Issues
To report a security issue, please [publish a private security advisory](https://github.com/NodeSecure/vulnera/security/advisories) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

Our vulnerability management team will respond within one week. If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a Security Advisory and acknowledge your contributions as part of it. This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.
