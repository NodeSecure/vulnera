# Synk

[Snyk](https://snyk.io/fr)  Snyk Limited is a developer-oriented cybersecurity company, specializing in securing custom developed code, open-source dependencies and cloud infrastructure.

## Implementation Notes

the Snyk integration uses the REST API (v1) available at [snyk.io](https://snyk.io/api/v1/test/npm) to perfom security audit.


### Search Parameters

### Headers

we also need to pass the `Authorization` header with the token generated by Synk.

### Format

The Synk interface is exported as root like `SnykAuditResponse`.

```ts
export interface SnykAuditResponse {
  /** Does this package have one or more issues? **/
  ok: boolean;
  /** The issues found. **/
  issues: {
    vulnerabilities: SnykVulnerability[];
    licenses: SnykVulnerability[];
  };
  /** The number of dependencies the package has. **/
  dependencyCount: number;
  /** The organization this test was carried out for. **/
  org: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  };
  /** The organization's licenses policy used for this test **/
  licensesPolicy: null | object;
  /** The package manager for this package **/
  packageManager: string;
}
```
